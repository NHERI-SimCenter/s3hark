 *
 *  This is an abstract interface providing interface SimCenter widgets must adhere to. At present limited to
 * providing methods to read and write from/to JSON objects and signals the class can use to invoke slot methods
 * in main window classes. This is to allow uniform handling of error messages in an application comprised of
 * different widgets.
